# OrderedArrayList

## Class Discussion

* We have to import java.util.ArrayList to extend it.
* The syntax for creating new Holder<T> objects (from the example) includes () because it is still a constructor but it has no arguments.
* We can base our re-written constructors on our old SuperArray code
* We can use "super" to wrap our methods for ArrayList.
* Super should also be used in the constructors, making them very simple in NoNullArrayList
